# Multilingual-RAG

## Overview
Multilingual-RAG is an innovative question-answering system that can understand and generate responses in multiple languages. Built on the robust architecture of large language models (LLMs) with Retrieve-And-Generate (RAG) capabilities, this application leverages Cohere's multilingual embeddings, LanceDB vector store, LangChain for question answering, and Argos Translate for seamless translation between languages. The user interface is powered by Gradio, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.

## Features
Multilingual Interaction: Ask questions in your preferred language and receive accurate responses in the same language.

Cohere Multilingual Embeddings: Leverages Cohere's powerful multilingual embeddings for understanding and generating text in multiple languages.

LanceDB Vector Store: Utilizes LanceDB for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings, ensuring fast and relevant responses.

LangChain for Q&A: Employs LangChain for sophisticated question-answering capabilities, providing contextually relevant and detailed answers.

Argos Translate for Translation: Integrates Argos Translate for additional translation support, ensuring language versatility.

Gradio Interface: Offers a user-friendly Gradio interface for easy interaction with the system.

## How It Works
Query Input: The system accepts a user query in any supported language through the Gradio interface.
Embedding and Retrieval: Cohere's multilingual embeddings are used to understand the query and retrieve relevant documents from LanceDB.
Answer Generation: LangChain processes the retrieved documents to generate a response that accurately addresses the query.
Translation: If needed, Argos Translate is used to translate the response into the desired language.
Response Delivery: The response is delivered to the user through the Gradio interface in the language of the query.

## Supported Languages
Multilingual-RAG is designed to support 100+ languages . The exact list of supported languages is dependent on the capabilities of the Cohere multilingual model and Argos Translate.
